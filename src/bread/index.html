    <h1>Learning HTML</h1>

    <p>Here's a plain-text recipe for making <a href="bread-recipe.txt">No Knead Bread</a>.</p>

    <p>Here's an HTML version of the same recipe for making <a href="bread-recipe.html">No Knead Bread</a>.</p>

    <p><i>Elements</i> (or <i>tags</i>) define the semantics of your HTML doc: <a href="swapping-songs.html">Simple HTML Document</a></p>

    <p>You can use any element you want to add semantics. For example, here's the bread recipe using a completely made up element &lt;block&gt;:  <a href="bread-recipe-2.html">No Knead Bread</a>.</p>

    <p>You didn't see any change with the new element &lt;block&gt;? Hmmm... perhaps it would help if you styled the new element as well:  <a href="bread-recipe-3.html">No Knead Bread</a>.</p>

    <p>Here's the recipe marked up with standard HTML elements:  <a href="bread-recipe-html.html">No Knead Bread</a>.</p>

    <p>It's far too common (and easy) to conflate styling with semantics. If I use CSS and a &lt;style&gt; block to make our &lt;h2&gt; elements appear larger than our &lt;h1&gt;, does that change the semantics as well?:  <a href="bread-recipe-css.html">No Knead Bread</a>.</p>

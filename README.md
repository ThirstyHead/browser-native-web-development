# Browser-Native Web Development

Netflix saw a 50% performance improvement when they removed React from their landing page. Moving to Google's Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) project lead publishers like Gizmodo and the Times of India to see 300% performance improvements. Their secret? Removing client-side JavaScript. 

In this keynote, Scott Davis (Principal Engineer, ThoughtWorks) demonstrates what framework-free web development looks like by taking you on a guided tour of practical, commonsense examples. Note that this doesn't mean JavaScript-free development; rather, it means a balanced approach that combines HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a holistic way that leverages the strengths of each. The end result is a solution that is measured in single digit kilobytes, often less than a hundred or two lines of code. Along the way, you'll also learn how to create a measurable web performance budget based on real-world empirical thresholds.
